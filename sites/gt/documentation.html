<h1>GOVTECH2</h1>

<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>it looks like we are moving from a SAAS (Software As A Service) to a PAAS (PLatform As A Service) model I found the following</p>
<p>Rackspace's Cloud Sites   <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/Cloud_Sites">http://www.rackspace.com/Cloud_Sites</a>                 </p>
<p>Media Temple's Grid Service</p> <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">http://mediatemple.net/</a> 
<p>dotcloud,  based in San francisco, small   <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com/">https://www.dotcloud.com/</a> DotCloud runs on Amazon EC2. More specifically, we run on the us-east-1 region, across multiple availability zones.</p>
<p>cloudcontrol, based in EU? <a href="http://cloudcontrol.com/">http://cloudcontrol.com/</a> </p>
<p>phpfog   <a href="www.appfog.com">appfog.com</a>  (still in private beta)</p>
host and replicate php apps




<h2>software layers</h2>

The software needs to be layered as follows
<ul class='layer'>
<li>page layer</li>
<li>website layer, code for the specific content, css etc</li>
<li>core layer, very generic</li>
<li>php on apache , memcache? ,  database(whichever we choose)</li>
</ul>


<h3>why layers?</h3>
<p>thinking about the code as being in layers gives us the following advantages:
<br>- Different levels of testing, for example a core-level change has to go through a lot more testing
<br>- Code review, for example core-level change has to have a code review
<br>- Documentation, for example core-level change has to have the documentation changed, and this should be qa'ed as well'
</p>


<h3>page layer</h3>
<p>this layer deals with individual pages, changes will opnly affect a single page
</p>


<h3>website layer</h3>
<p>this layer deals with the websites, changes will affect a website.
for example the css files for a site fit into this category
