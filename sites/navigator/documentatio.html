<h2>Navigator Rebuild</h2>

current assumptions:

- rebuild navigator
- move user admin form sf into the navigator , upload some data to sf

- use php
- use mysql
- host at rack space
- don't use nmi
- move away from ext towards html(5) and jquery and jqueryui
- use mvc model
- use Smarty3  for templates
- use memcache
- no versioning of data is required




Here is a preliminary list of tasks in the order that they will be started. since the whole process will be very iterative,
most tasks will not be totally completed until very late in the cycle.  
For simplicity I omited ''design'.  all tasks will have their own design phase 




tasks:

1- create infra structure 
  error handling
  folder structure
  naming convention
  documentation convention
  develop test harness and test convention
  GIT repo
  find a test server
   
2- create data model
3- fill data model with data  through migration scripts
 
4- build model classes
  
5- build page-controllers to connect the templates with the model
   - copy the old templates
   
5a- redo the search module

(while doing this the data-model will be refined, and the model, and migration scripts have to be adjusted)

At this point we have something that resembles a bare bones version of the navigator, since all the 
retrieval queries are in place, we can see how the new datamodel performs

6- add caching,  template caching and memcache 

7-redo all forms, move away from ext towards jqueryui and html

8-redo the data-entry scripts and forms
9-build a brand new user-admin panel, with an update script to load data into sf

10-return to the migration scripts, and add data cleaning , add entity-id to the orgs

11-redo the erate loader

12-adjust the bidpush script

13- test test test
14- move code to rackspace, setup automatic backup etc.

15- do stress test

16- final migration

17-cut-over  (DNS changes)

As mentioned before, given the complexity we will have to follow an iterative approach.
